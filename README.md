# SDA_FYP_IanCoady - The P2pe Manager Mobile v1.0

This Repo is the Final Year Project Submission for the SDA Module in DCU's Higher Diploma in Software Development.

This is an android application based on the existing web aplication owned by Bluefin Payment Systems, The P2pemanager.

In short, the p2pemanager is an inventory/deployment application for payment terminals so Bluefin's merchants can ship, activate, deploy, retire
and manage their devices and store them in a neat and tidy web application.

My aim for this project was to prototype elements of that functionality inside of an android application - primarily the inventory functionality.

My application is a simple CRUD app that stores the devices and their details inside of a Firebase Database and displays the saved devices to the user in a Recycler View fortmat
inside the Android App. The user can then Edit or Delete the devices based on their needs.

Before the user can access the app though, they will need a valid Google account otherwise they will not be able to log in and access the application.

All code adaptations and snippets are referenced inside of the code, but I would like to make a special methion to the code writers and tutors of the HDSD course in DCU, without their samples 
and documentation I doubt this project would have been a success.
